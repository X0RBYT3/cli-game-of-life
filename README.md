# CLI implementation of Conway's Game of Life

To use the script, save it as game_of_life.py and run it from the command line:


```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

You can also customize the grid size, update speed, and number of iterations using command-line arguments:

```bash
python game_of_life.py -r 30 -c 80 -s 0.05 -i 100
```

This will create a 30x80 grid, updating every 0.05 seconds, and run for 100 iterations.
